		<!-- Overview -->
		<div class="col-8">
			<h1 class="handwriting" style="font-size:2em">Hello!</h1>

			<p>My name is Meghan Thommes and I'm currently a PhD Candidate at Boston University! I'm in the Department of Biomedical Engineering and I work for Daniel Segr&egrave;. My research focuses on using computational tools to understand and design microbial communities.</p>

			<p> I'm defending in the fall of 2019 and am looking for a full-time position as a computational biologist or data scientist. I'd love to continue working on microbial communities, but am also interested in neurology and rare diseases.</p>

			<p> <!-- Dogs -->
				I have two dogs, both of which are nine years old and half Pomeranian and half American Eskimo Dog. They are a brother-sister bonded pair that I adopted on Halloween in 2017. Vin (female) was named after a main character in Brandon Sanderson's <em>Mistborn</em> series. Fitz (male) was named after FitzChivalry in Robin Hobb's <em>The Realm of the Elderlings</em> series.
