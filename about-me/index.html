<div class="about">
	<!-- Overview -->
	<div class="row">
		<p> <!-- Blurb -->
			I'm a <span class="emphasize">computational biologist</span> and <span class="emphasize">data scientist</span> with <span class="emphasize">gene therapy</span> and <span class="emphasize">microbial communities</span> expertise.
			I specialize in data visualization, computational pipeline automation, and ad-hoc tool development using Python.
		</p>

		<p> <!-- Dyno -->
			Most recently, I worked as a <span class="emphasize">Computational Biologist</span> at <span class="emphasize"><a href="https://www.dynotx.com/" target="_blank">Dyno Therapeutics</a></span>, a gene therapy company that designs vectors for targeted delivery.
			There, I developed a pipeline to analyze high-throughput NGS data in order to evaluate the manufacturability and assess the quality of AAV capsids.
			I collaborated with wet-lab scientists to design experiments, develop new approaches to data generation, and generate reports for internal stakeholders, as well as software and data engineers to construct and improve analysis frameworks and data access and standardization tools used by all computational biologists.
		</p>

		<p> <!-- Joyn -->
			Prior to Dyno, I was a <span class="emphasize">Data Scientist</span> at <span class="emphasize"><a href="https://joynbio.com/" target="_blank">Joyn Bio</a></span>, a biotechnology company that engineered microbes for agricultural applications.
			At Joyn, I built data integration pipelines and developed modeling frameworks to predict how engineered microbes would perform <em>in planta</em> based on how they performed <em>in vitro</em>.
			I also collaborated with scientists to implement and test Benchling as an ELN/LIMS system; built data integration tools to clean, standardize, and consolidate data across departments; and developed interactive dashboards in Tableau.
		</p>

		<p> <!-- School -->
			I completed my PhD with <a href="https://www.bu.edu/segrelab/" target="_blank">Daniel Segr&egrave;</a> at <a href="https://www.bu.edu/eng/departments/bme/" target="_blank">Boston University</a> (thesis: <a href="https://open.bu.edu/handle/2144/41030?show=full" target="_blank"><em>Strategies for engineering microbial communities</em></a>).
			There, I developed and applied a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) algorithm to predict and understand division of labor strategies in microbial communities under simulated conditions (<em><a href="https://msystems.asm.org/content/4/2/e00263-18/" target="_blank">Designing metabolic division of labor in microbial communities</a></em>).
			I also performed linear regression and feature selection to classify yeast strains based on growth on different carbon sources (<em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-024-06093-w" target="_blank">Multi-Attribute Subset Selection enables prediction of representative phenotypes across microbial populations</a></em>).

		<p> <!-- Fun -->
			When I'm not working, I enjoy traveling, skiing, reading, playing video and board games, and hanging out with my husband, two dogs, and cat.
