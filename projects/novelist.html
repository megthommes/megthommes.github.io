	<h2>NoveList</h2>
	<h5>A web app that recommends books based on user input.</h5>

	<p>
		Built in Februrary 2020 as part of the <a href="https://insightfellows.com/health-data" target="_blank">Insight Health Data Fellows Program</a>. As an avid reader, I often find it difficult to prioritize which books I'd like to read out of my ever-growing to-read pile (so many books, so little time!). Consequently, I created NoveList!
	</p>

	<p>
		I built, trained, and evaluated a collaborative filtering recommender system in Jupyter Notebooks with scikit-surprise, pandas, numpy, and seaborn. I then deployed NoveList using streamlit and Heroku. While I no longer maintain the app, you can view a demo below.
	</p>

	<p>
		In a perfect world, I'd train an LLM on the book text themselves to recommend books based on content, but that's a project for another day!
