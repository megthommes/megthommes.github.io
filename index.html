				I'm currently a PhD Candidate at <a href="https://www.bu.edu/eng/departments/bme/" target="_blank">Boston University</a> in the Department of Biomedical Engineering. I work with <a href="https://www.bu.edu/segrelab/" target="_blank">Daniel Segr&egrave;</a> to investigate microbial communities.
			</p>

			<p>
				I worked with Taiyao Wang, Qi Zhao, Yannis Paschalidis, and Daniel Segr&egrave; to develop a method (<a href="https://msystems.asm.org/content/4/2/e00263-18/article-info" target="_blank"><strong>D</strong>ivision <strong>O</strong>f <strong>L</strong>abor in <strong>M</strong>icrobial <strong>N</strong>etworks</a>) to predict how microbes share tasks (or don't) in communities. We applied a <strong>M</strong>ixed <strong>I</strong>nteger <strong>L</strong>inear <strong>P</strong>rogram (MILP) to a metabolic model of <em>Escherichia coli</em> to create different strains of <em>E. coli</em> and predict their growth rates and metabolism. We limited the number of metabolic reactions each <em>E. coli</em> strain can perform, thereby reducing their metabolic capabilities, and observed that specialized strains in communities could survive with less individual metabolic reactions than isolated strains, catalogued which metabolites were exchanged, and identified several different specialization strategies.
			</p>

			<p>
				I'm now formulating a MILP approach with Yannis Paschalidis and Daniel Segr&egrave; to predict how different yeast strains will grow in a variety of environments.
